# Go experiments

## Playing with algorithms in Go


- mySort: Insertion Sort and Merge Sort example, with benchmarks.
- myList: Linked List + API.

Those algorithms are for learning purpose. They are already implemented in Go standard library. Go Standard library
should thus be used instead for real production code.
